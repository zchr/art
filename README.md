# Art
A Chrome extension that gives quick art history lesson with each new tab.

## It's live!
Just head over to the [Chrome Web Store](https://developer.chrome.com/webstore/publish) and download it.

## Under the hood
> We use computer vision, deep learning algorithms, and sensor fusion, much like you'd find in self-driving cars.

Just kidding--that's [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/b?node=16008589011).

 This thing just grabs an image by searching the MET's database. For an element of surprise, it randomly grabs a material, the method by which it sorts, and the number of results (and the page number) to return.

### More like this
If you find yourself really enjoying results for, say, `color lithographs`, click the `more like this` button to increase the prevalence going forward.

## Thank you, MET
In February, they released hundreds of thousands of photos of art. In doing so, they both inspired this project as a means to absorb more art and made it possible. Thank you.
